# Motivation

Classification of Brain tumour is very helpful for the radiologist to affirm their diagnosis.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/rithanathith/Special-Topics---8893--Project-/blob/branch_1_RA/pics/brain_detect.png)

WHO estimates the more than 4 lakh children are suffering from tumour every year.Early detection of tumour lead to better chance of survival
Detection of brain tumour MRI images.

# What makes good detector ?
 1. Good detection - able to detect as many edges as possible
 2. Good Localization  - able to match the exact location of edges with original images
 3. Response time - detect true edges (scenario of edges detected twice, noice can create false edges)

## Latency

> Sobel algorithm - simple & takes less time.

> Canny algorithm - complex and provides sharp edges

## Performance wise

Canny > Sobel

Canny gives good performance in the noisy images.

Computationally intensive >> more power and delay 
for matching the real time constraints.

 Our goal is to optimize the computationally intensive canny algorithm and prune out the unwanted edges from the MRI image.


## Noise removal 

Conver the RGB to grayscale image 

Step 1 : Guassian Filter - Smoothening the image by bluring .
We subtract the original image with o/p of guassian filtered Image. This is called Unsharp Masking.

> * Blur the image by guassian low pass filter

***

Step 2 : Compute Guassian value G, Guassian direction (edge angle).

The conventional Sobel contains horizontal and vertical convolution, and the Sobel operator uses two matrices to convolve the original image to calculate an estimate of the gray difference (partial
derivative) in two directions (horizontal and vertical).

> Gx and Gy

Gx = Image * Horizontal_ Kernal 

Gy = Image * Vertical_ Kernal 

> * Sober Filtering and compute magnitute and phase 

G = root (Gx ^2 + Gy^2) = mod(Gx) + mod(Gy)

phase fi = 90 degree , mod(Gx) < mod(Gy)

phase fi = 0 degree , mod(Gx) > mod(Gy)

***

***
Above method of detection has the problem of low edge detection accuracy.

For example, the liver and other objects with closed contour still have the loss of edges in some directions.
***

Solution is to increase the no. of kernals convolved with image in various direction. But this will increase the memory access latency and on chip power. Also less efficient in noisly image.

So we need to formulate some technique which can take care of suppressing the unwanted edges and make it sharper. >> CANNY ALGORITHM

***

Step 3 : Non max suppresion - Edge Thinning 
local maxima is location where the change in intensity is very keen.

>Convert the blurred egdes to sharp edges
>preserve all the local maxima in the gradient image and delete everythign else

1. Round the gradient direction to nearest 45◦, corresponding to the use of an 8-connected neighborhood.
2. Compare the edge strength of the current pixel with the edge strength of the pixel in the positive and negative gradient direction. I.e. if the gradient direction is north (theta = 90◦), compare with the pixels to the north and south.
3. If the edge strength of the current pixel is largest; preserve the value of the edge strength. If not, suppress (i.e. remove) the value.

***

Step 4: Double Hysteresis Threshold -  to decrease incorrect edge points and detect the true edges.

** Set the high and low threshold

> T high  and
> T low

*  T high saturates every pixel with a gradient value greater than its threshold value. 
*  T low bypasses every pixel with a gradient value greater than its threshold value.
  
*  The output of these two blocks are added up, resulting in a stream where the saturated pixels are considered part of the edges and the other pixels different than zero are considered edge candidates.


## Memory Access 

DMA - Direct memory access - AXI lite protocal which is address mapped protocal.

PL - Canny IP is axi stream protocal for getting burst of data with no address.

Bus arbitrater decides when DMA or processor has to act like master on the system bus 

UART - Host PC and BOARD


## Analyze 

* Mean Square Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)
* Entropy
* Signal to Noise Ration(SNR) 
* Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR)


• A thorough comparison between both solutions in terms of resource usage, execution time, and programming effort. In this way, we can identify the strengths and weaknesses of each programming approach in the image processing field.
